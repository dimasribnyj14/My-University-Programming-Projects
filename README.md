# C++ Lab Works

This repository contains materials and solutions for laboratory work on **C++** programming.
These materials were taken from documents with laboratory work, which belong to [National Technical University 'Dnipro Polytechnic'](https://nmu.org.ua/).

## Lab Work #1: Data Types and Basic Algorithmic Operations

### Theoretical Foundations

The foundation of any program is the manipulation of variable values. Most programs come down to performing arithmetic, logical, or bitwise operations. C++ allows for the calculation of values with the ability to input initial values and get results almost instantly. Variables are not only needed for calculations but also for storing values in memory, and no program can do without them.

## Lab Work #2: Program Branching Based on Conditional Operators

### Theoretical Foundations

Just like in real life, a program might encounter a situation where the choice made depends on some event, and this choice determines the further path of calculations. In programming, such situations are called **branching**. Branching is one of the most important features of programming, allowing for different results depending on a given condition.

For this lab, you should learn to apply three methods of branching:
* **`if`** statements 
* **`switch`** statements 
* The **ternary operator**
